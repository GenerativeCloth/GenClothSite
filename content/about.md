GenCloth is a 3D toolkit for the next generation of fashion designers.  The toolkit includes a software plugin + tools + databases to actively support customization and rapid local production. These tools aid in designing customized pieces for clientele, speed up production timelines within local micro factories, and aid in the production of durable & sustainable designs that add further value into fashion.

<br/>
Globally the fashion industry continues towards further sustainability and a healthier industry cycle, we look to the next generation of designers to help with this mission. Local designers, new influencers and brands can begin changes from the beginning of the design process completely through to the end of life of the garment, ensuring sustainability throughout. Enabling these future designers and future brands with fresh tools can help create more positive growth within the fashion industry and produce correlating positive effects for our planet, society and ourselves.

<br/>
The GenCloth process begins with each individual, effectively shifting the focus from a mass production design process, to a mass customization process & designing for the individual. Designing for our uniqueness injects value and health into fashion by leveraging body positivity, reality design, and ease within each personal piquancy. Focused design can also ensure to include ‘end of life’ design from the start of the design process. The GenCloth toolkit includes tools to turn a 3D design into nested 2D pattern pieces ready to be cut and produced. The databases aid in complementing the process with open body datasets, parametric mannequins, sustainable textiles and notions, construction, durability and alterability methods. For example, a designer adding further alterability to the pattern pieces can effectively extend the life of the garment and add further value into the garment.

<br/>
The basis of GenCloth research and development began in 2010 in Barcelona, Spain. Since then the team has worked with clients and designers alike to continue to develop the GenCloth platform.

<br/>
