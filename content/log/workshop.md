You are invited to a 3 day workshop on digital technologies for the future of fashion design.

Advanced digital technologies allow us to rethink the process of traditional fashion design and pattern drafting. Are you interested in envisioning how we will design and consume fashion in 2030?

Elizabeth Bigger, a wearable technology expert with extensive experience in draping and patterning, and Luis Fraguada, a programmer and designer, have developed the GenCloth toolkit of software tools and databases for the future of fashion design. The goal of GenCloth is to empower local fashion designers with 3D software toolkits for rapid client customization in order to grow local talent & local economies.

If you are curious on how you can apply digital technologies to your own fashion design process, join us!

The workshop will take place October 9th-11th from 18H to 20H at Elisava. We have limited places (10) for the event, if you have interest in participating please send your CV and why you’d like to participate to contact@gencloth.com.

GenCloth, as part of the Barcelona and ModaFAD ecosystem, asks if there is interest from any fashion design professionals to participate in a free 3 day workshop with GenCloth. The GenCloth team feels it is imperative to discuss how digital design tools, circular design economy and technology can aid in the Barcelona fashion ecosystem. We’d like designers to spend some time with our digital tools, create body scans and design in 3D, discussing digital design processes and the future of fashion. We see this as aperitif to a larger conversation within the ModaFAD + Barcelona community about Fashion 2030, which will take place in December.

GenCloth is part of the WEAR Sustain Program: Wearable Technologists Engage with Artists for Responsible Innovation. WEAR encourages the collaboration between artist and technologist to further future collaborations for innovation within the EU, specifically related to wearable technology and fashion design. GenCloth is a 3D design toolkit for the next generation of fashion designers. The toolkit includes a software plugin + tools + databases to actively support garment customization, design and rapid local garment production.
